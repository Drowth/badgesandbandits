  <h1>How to Play</h1>
  <p>Welcome to <strong>Badges & Bandits</strong> — a gritty, social deduction card game about bluffing, bullets, and betrayal.</p>
  <div class="back-button">
    <button onclick="window.location.href='index.html'">⬅ Back to Home</button>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Why I Made This Game</h2>
    <p>I’ve always loved games like Coup, Bang!, and Secret Hitler — ones full of second guessing, accusations, and betrayal. I wanted to create something with that same energy, but set in the Wild West. A place where you don’t know who to trust, and every smile might hide a pistol.</p>
    <p>This game is my first attempt at designing something from the ground up — and with the help of my playgroup, it’s already sparked showdowns, chaos, and plenty of “you what?!” moments. If you enjoy out-bluffing your mates, this one’s for you.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Quick Summary</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You're either a Badge (Sheriff, Deputy, Marshal’s Courier) or a Bandit (or Ringleader)</li>
      <li>Choose a location, play an action card, resolve chaos</li>
      <li>After Rounds 3 & 5, players vote to hang someone</li>
      <li>Bandits win by pulling off 3 Heists or killing the Sheriff</li>
      <li>Badges win by hanging the Ringleader (after ≥1 Heist) or stopping all Heists</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Setup</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Deal 1 Role Card to each player (face down)</li>
      <li>Use either Standard Roles or the Ringleader Recruitment phase (see below)</li>
      <li>Place 5 Location Cards in a central pool</li>
      <li>Each player receives 6 Action Cards</li>
      <li>Shuffle and place the Item Deck</li>
      <li>Set Suspicion, Damage, Round Tracker, and Heist Token Pile on the table</li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Role Options</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Ringleader:</strong> Head of the Bandits. Must be hanged to lose.</li>
      <li><strong>Bandit:</strong> Standard outlaw. Can perform Heists and defend allies.</li>
      <li><strong>Sheriff:</strong> Law’s leader. Must be protected.</li>
      <li><strong>Deputy:</strong> Law-aligned, cannot Heist.</li>
      <li><strong>Marshal's Courier:</strong> Once per game, may change locations after all actions are revealed.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Ringleader Recruitment Phase</h2>
    <p>Only the Ringleader knows their role at first. All others have law aligned cards.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>All players close eyes with their role cards out in front of them</li>
      <li>The Ringleader opens their eyes and silently replaces 1–2 role cards with Bandit roles</li>
      <li>Everyone reopens their eyes and checks their (maybe new) role card, obviously everyone should be shocked and exclaim they have been changed, because thats just funny. (probably)</li>
    </ol>
    <p><em>“Everyone, close your eyes and hold out your hand. Ringleader, open your eyes… select your allies… now close them. Everyone may open their eyes.”</em></p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Round Structure</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>1. Location Draft:</strong> Players pick a location (round-robin)</li>
      <li><strong>2. Play Actions:</strong> Secretly play one card (Heist, Buy, Shoot, etc.)</li>
      <li><strong>3. Reveal & Resolve:</strong> Location by location, cards are flipped and effects are resolved</li>
      <li><strong>4. Apply Effects:</strong> Heists, Suspicion, Damage, Items</li>
      <li><strong>5. Gallows Phase:</strong> After Rounds 3 & 5 — vote to hang someone</li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Victory Conditions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Bandits Win:</strong> 3 Heists succeed or the Sheriff dies</li>
      <li><strong>Badges Win:</strong> Ringleader is hanged (after ≥1 Heist) or no Heists by Round 5</li>
      <li><em>Optional:</em> In games with 6+ players, Ringleader must be hanged</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Snake Oil Curses (Item Cards)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Grizzly Growl:</strong> You must growl like a bear before speaking. Forget? Gain 1 Suspicion.</li>
      <li><strong>Rattlesnake Reflex:</strong> Flinch or mime drawing a pistol every time someone says your name. Fail? Gain 1 Suspicion.</li>
      <li><strong>Cactus Cramp:</strong> Stops a player from playing “Buy” next round.</li>
      <li><strong>Thuthpithuthly Happy Fever:</strong> Speak with an exaggerated lisp for the rest of the game. Drop the act? Anyone can assign you Suspicion.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Duels</h2>
    <p>Sometimes two players will find themselves in a <strong>1v1 standoff</strong>. When that happens, the table pauses and a <strong>Duel Showdown</strong> begins.</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Dealer of Fate:</strong> The first player eliminated from the game <em>or</em> the last player to scratch their nose becomes the Dealer of Fate. They take the two Duel Action Cards and lay them facedown in a random order.</li>
      <li><strong>Face-Off:</strong> The two dueling players raise their finger pistols and lock eyes. The Dealer counts down loud and clear: “5… 4… 3… 2… 1… DRAW!”</li>
      <li><strong>Quickdraw:</strong> At “DRAW!”, both duelists must slam their hands down, grab the Duel Cards, and arrange them in the correct order (Attack → Resolution) as fast as possible.</li>
      <li><strong>Winner:</strong> The first duelist to correctly lay out the order wins the duel. If both complete at the exact same time, the Dealer of Fate chooses the winner.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><em>Optional Variant:</em> If your group prefers less theatrics, simply have both duelists flip one card each simultaneously instead of performing the Quickdraw.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Action: Stakeout</h2>
    <p>As an action, a player may choose to play <strong>Stakeout</strong>. This allows the player to secretly peek at <strong>2 face-down Action Cards</strong> in the exact order they are currently arranged.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The player may then return the cards in the same order.</li>
      <li>They may share their findings with the table — truthfully, deceptively, or not at all.</li>
      <li>Other players must decide whether to believe them, adding a new layer of bluff and mistrust.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Remember:</em> The power of Stakeout lies as much in what you <strong>say</strong> as in what you actually saw.</p>
